# Go Event Operator

                A Go service via Dockerfile that fetches data specifically from GCP Pub/Sub,
                performs financial calculations, and updates results in the Pub/Sub message bus.
                
                Inputs can be passed at instantiation for testing to simulate within larger microservice cloud
                platform. Outputs can be optionally printed as JSONL to shell.
